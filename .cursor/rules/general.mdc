This is a Unity 6.2 project.
Our custom c# code is found in Assets/Scripts
The project is a 2D game that is still in early development with ideas of being a blend of idle clicker with upgradeable elements and resource management.

For simple if statements that return on some condition or similar, I prefer a one line format:
```
if (Time.time - _lastTriggerTime < cooldownSeconds) return;
```
