Don't make code formatting changes unless you need to change those lines of code.

This is a Unity 6.2 project.
Our custom c# code is found in Assets/Scripts
The project is a 2D game that is still in early development that is experimenting with musical and rhythm based gameplay mechanics.

### --- Coding Style Guidelines --- 
- For simple if statements that return on some condition or similar, I prefer a one line format: `if (Time.time - _lastTriggerTime < cooldownSeconds) return;`
- Provide high level code commenting when creating new code to help the developer understand the basic flow.
- Code lines should be logically grouped and organized into small stanza blocks, and every stanza should have a comment explaining its purpose. The code should have a nice, readable comment rhythm without being overly verbose.
- Comments should provide examples for complex logic or calculations to help clarify intent.
- Add multiline/block comments (/** style) to all methods unless they are very trivial that explain the purpose of the function.

### --- Tooling ---
- I'm using Odin Inspector. When it is sensible for important or complex components, I like to have manual controls to invoke script elements from the editor for testing and create nicer organizations using Odin for elements and properties for a clean editing experience.
- I'm using Unity Atoms. Much of the time, Unity Atoms can be overkill when you can just create simple linkages, but it should be used in some cases if it may add substantial benefit for maintability. If a situation arises that looks like a good use for it, ask me if we should use it in the implementation.
- I'm using DOTeen Pro for some tweeing and animations, but for simple things it's often better to code them without it than to introduce a dependency, but where DOTween may provide substantial benefit, particularly for tweaking and experimentation in the editor, you can use it.
- I'm using TextMeshPro text rendering.
