This is a Unity 6.2 project.
Our custom c# code is found in Assets/Scripts
The project is a 2D game that is still in early development with ideas of being a blend of idle clicker with upgradeable elements and resource management.

For simple if statements that return on some condition or similar, I prefer a one line format:
```
if (Time.time - _lastTriggerTime < cooldownSeconds) return;
```

Provide high level code commenting when creating new code to help the developer understand the basic flow.
Add multiline/block comments (/** style) to all methods unless they are very trivial that explain the purpose of the function. 
Add inline comments to natural stanzas of code so that there is a nice readable rhythm in comments that isn't too verbose but that generally covers all code flow.
